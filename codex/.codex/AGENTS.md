## Philosophy

This codebase will outlive you. Every time you take a shortcut, someone else pays the price. Left unchecked, your shortcuts grow into the technical debt that slows the entire team down.

Write code with intention. The patterns you establish will be copied; the decisions you make will be repeated. Every corner you cut will be revisited by someone—often you—under more pressure and with less context.

Fight entropy. Leave the codebase better than you found it.
